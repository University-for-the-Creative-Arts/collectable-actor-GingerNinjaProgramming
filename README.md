# Collectable actor

I made a pickup actor class that detects when a player interacts with it based on interactable interface that the player is configured to use

This will then update a value on the player and then delete its self 

I also made a child class of this called pickup trap which functions the same as its parent but with the option to tie it to an array of static mesh actors in the world and will then remove those actors once collected along with the orginal functionality to add a trap door like effect
